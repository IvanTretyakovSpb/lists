/**
 * Flyweight is a structural design pattern that allows us
 * to use the same elements in different contexts to lower RAM usage.
 * Flyweight - a pattern that increases the number of objects
 * we can fit into memory by sharing and reusing their common parts.
 * This pattern applies to a project with a large number of objects to fit them all into your memory.
 * This pattern's purpose is to store common parts of multiple objects in a single class
 * instead of keeping data inside of each object.
 * Itâ€™s very important that the flyweight objects are immutable:
 * any operation on the state must be performed by the factory.
